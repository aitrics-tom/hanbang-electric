171.4 검사
171.4.1 방사선투과검사 기법
단일벽 촬영기법을 원칙으로 하나, 단일벽 촬영기법을 사용하기가 곤란한 경우에는,
이중벽 촬영기법을 사용할 수 있다. 파이프 또는 튜브 용접부에 대한 선원 및 필름배
```
치와 적정촬영횟수는 KECS-1201의 1.1(파이프 또는 튜브 용접부에 대한 촬영기법)에
```
따른다.
1. 단일벽 촬영 기법
단일벽 촬영기법에서 방사선은 용접부의 한쪽 벽만을 투과하며, 이는 방사선투과사
진의 합부판정을 위해 촬영된다.
2. 이중벽 촬영기법
단일벽 촬영기법을 사용하는 것이 곤란할 때는, 다음의 이중벽 촬영기법 중 하나가
사용되어야 한다.
가. 단일벽 관찰
검사체내의 재료 및 용접부의 경우 방사선이 두 벽을 투과하고 필름측 벽의 용
접부 만이 방사선투과사진의 합부판정을 위해 관찰되는 촬영기법이 사용될 수
있다. 전 구간 촬영법위가 원주용접부에 요구되는 경우, 원주 용접부 각각에 대
해 120°간격으로 최소 3회의 촬영이 실시되어야 한다.
나. 이중벽 관찰
공칭 바깥지름이 89㎜ 이하인 검사체내의 재료 및 용접부의 경우, 방사선이 두
벽을 투과하고 양쪽 벽의 용접부가 동일한 방사선투과사진에서 합부판정을 위해
관찰되는 촬영기법이 사용될 경우, 상질계는 선원 측에만 사용되어야 하며, 요구
되는 기하학적 불선명도를 초과하지 않도록 확인하는 것이 바람직하다. 만일 기
하학적 불선명도 요건이 만족되지 않는 경우에는 단일벽 관찰이 사용되어야 한
다.

171.4.2 기하학적 불선명도
1. 기하학적 불선명도 결정
방사선투과사진의 기하학적 불선명도는 다음과 같이 결정하여야 한다.
```

D = 방사선원에서 촬영할 용접부 또는 검사체까지의 거리, mm,
```
```
d = 촬영할 용접부 또는 검사체의 선원측에서 필름까지의 거리, mm.
```
2. 기하학적 불선명도의 제한
방사선투과사진의 기하학적 불선명도는 표171.4.2의 값을 초과해서는 아니 된다.

가. 과잉 수세성 침투제는 물 분무기로 제거하여야 한다. 수압은 345 ㎪을 초과하지
않아야 하고, 수온은 43℃를 초과해서는 안 된다.
나. ‘가’의 대안으로, 수세성 침투액은 침투액 흔적이 거의 없어질 때까지 깨끗하
고 마른 보푸라기가 없는 천 또는 흡수성 종이로 닦는 작업을 반복하여 제거해도
된다. 남아있는 흔적은 물을 살짝 적신 천 또는 흡수성 종이로 표면을 닦아 제거해
야 한다. 불연속부 내부의 침투제가 제거되는 것을 최소화 하기 위해, 과도한 물 사
용은 피하도록 주의해야 한다.
2. 후유화성 침투제
가. 친유성 유화제
요구되는 침투제 유지시간이 지난 후, 표면의 과잉 침투제는 유화제에 부품을
담그거나, 흘림으로써 유화처리를 하여야 한다. 유화시간은 유화제의 종류 및 표
면상태에 관련이 있다. 실제 유화시간은 경험적으로 결정하여야 한다. 유화처리

있는 흔적은 용제를 묻힌 헝겊 또는 흡수성 종이로 표면을 가볍게 닦아내어 제
거하여야 한다. 불연속부로부터 침투제의 제거를 최소화하기 위해, 용제를 과도
하게 사용하지 않도록 주의하여야 한다. 침투제 적용 후와 현상처리 전에, 용제
를 표면에 흘리는 것은 금지된다.
174.6.4 과잉 침투제 제거 후의 건조

174.6.5 현상
현상제는 침투제 제거 후에 가능한 한 빨리 적용하여야 한다. 그 시간은 절차서에서
규정된 시간을 초과해서는 아니 된다. 현상제의 피막두께가 불충분하면 불연속부의
밖으로 침투제를 끌어내지 못할 수 있고, 현상제의 피막두께가 두꺼우면 지시모양을
가릴 수 있다. 염색침투제를 사용하는 경우에는 습식현상제만을 사용하여야 하고, 형
광침투제를 사용하는 경우에는 습식 또는 건식현상제가 사용될 수 있다.
1. 건식현상제의 적용
건식현상제는 부드러운 솔, 수동식 분무기, 가루 살포기, 또는 기타 방법을 이용하
여 가루가 검사할 표면 전체에 균일하게 도포될 수 있도록 건조된 표면에만 적용하
여야 한다.
2. 습식현상제의 적용
검사면에 현탁형 습식현상제를 적용하기 전에, 현탁된 입자가 잘 분산되도록 현상
제를 충분히 교반하여야 한다.

과하지 않는 한, 건조시간은 따뜻한 공기를 사용하여 단축할 수 있다. 빨아들이
```
기(blotting)는 허용되지 않는다.
```
나. 비수성현상제의 적용
비수성현상제는 안전 또는 접근의 제한으로 인해 분무법을 배제하는 경우를 제
외하고는 분무법으로 적용해야 한다. 분무법이 배제되는 경우 현상제는 솔질에
의해 적용할 수 있다. 수세성 또는 후유화성 침투제의 경우, 현상제는 건조한 표
면에 대해서 적용해야 한다. 용제 제거성 침투제의 경우, 현상제는 가능한 한 과
잉침투제가 제거된 후 바로 적용해야 하고 건조는 자연증발로 하여야 한다.
다. 현상시간
최종 판독을 위한 현상 시간은 건식 현상제를 적용한 직후 또는 습식 현상제의
현상막이 건조하자마자 시작된다.
174.6.6 판독
1. 최종 판독
최종 판독은 174.4.3에 따라 인정되지 않는다면, 174.6.5의 3의 요건을 만족한 후
```
10~60분 이내에 실시하여야 한다. 흡출(bleed out)이 검사결과를 변화시키지 않는다
```
면, 좀더 긴 시간도 허용된다. 검사할 표면이 규정된 또는 설정된 시간 내에 완전한
검사가 불가능할 정도로 아주 큰 제품인 경우, 검사는 단계적으로 실시하여야 한다.
- 137 -
2. 지시의 특징
침투제가 현상제 내에 과잉으로 퍼져 있다면 불연속부의 형태는 평가하기 어렵다.
이러한 상태가 발생한 경우, 현상제를 적용하는 동안에도 지시 형상에 대하여 자세
한 관찰을 하여야 한다.
3. 염색침투제
염색침투제를 사용하는 경우, 현상제는 적당히 균일한 흰색피막을 형성한다. 표면
불연속부는 일반적으로 현상제를 착색하는 짙은 붉은 색으로 침투제의 흡출에 의해
나타난다. 옅은 분홍색의 지시는 과도한 세척을 의미할 수도 있다. 부적절한 세척은
판독을 어렵게 하는 과도한 배경색을 남길 수 있다. 검사 및 지시를 평가하는 동안
적절한 감도를 확인할 수 있도록 검사할 표면에 최소 1076 lx의 조명강도가 필요하다.
빛의 강도, 자연광 또는 보조 백색광원은 지시를 평가하기 전에 백색광측정기로 측정
하거나 확인된 광원을 사용하여야 한다. 광원의 확인은 1회만 요구되고, 이 기록은 문
서화하여 관리하여야 한다.
4. 형광침투제
```
형광침투제를 사용하는 경우, 절차는 자외선(UV-A) 조사장치를 사용하는 것 이외에
```

가. 검사면에 교정된 백색광 측정기로 측정한 주변 밝기가 21.5 lx 이하인 어두운
장소에서 실시하여야 한다.
나. 검사원은 눈이 어두운 곳에서 보기에 적응할 수 있도록 검사를 하기 전에 적어
도 5분 동안 어두운 곳에 있어야 한다. 검사원이 착용하는 안경이나 렌즈는 감
광성이 없어야 한다.
다. 검사 영역은 320 nm ~ 400 nm 범위에서 작동하는 UV-A로 비추어야 한다.
라. 자외선은 검사하는 전 과정에 걸쳐 검사하는 부분의 표면에 1,000 μW/cm 2 이상
을 나타내어야 한다.
마. 반사체, 필터, 안경 및 렌즈는 사용 전에 점검하여야 하고, 필요하면 청소를 하
여야 한다. 균열이 있거나 부서진 반사체, 필터, 안경 또는 렌즈는 즉시 교체하
여야 한다.
바. 자외선의 세기는 사용 전, 전원이 차단되거나 변경되었을 때 마다, 그리고 전체
검사 또는 일련의 검사가 완료되었을 때 자외선 강도계로 측정하여야 한다.
사. 수은증기 아크램프는 형광유도를 위해 주로 365 nm의 피크파장에서 UV-A 파
장을 생성한다. 단일 UV-A 또는 UV-A LED를 사용한 LED UV-A는 다른 UV-A

을 이용하여 가능한 한 빨리 실시하여야 한다.
174.7 평가
1. 모든 지시는 참조규격의 합격표준을 근거로 평가하여야 한다.
2. 표면에 있는 불연속부는 침투제의 흡출에 의해 나타난다. 그러나, 기계가공 흔적
또는 다른 표면상태에 의한 부분적인 표면 불규칙은 의사 지시를 만들 수도 있다.
3. 불연속부의 지시모양을 가릴 수 있는 형광제 또는 염색제의 넓게 퍼진 부위는 검
사과정이 부적절하므로, 그러한 부위는 세척하고 재검사하여야 한다.

표 232.2-3 공사방법의 분류
232.3 배선설비 적용 시 고려사항
232.3.1 회로 구성
1. 하나의 회로도체는 다른 다심케이블, 다른 전선관, 다른 케이블덕팅시스템 또는 다
른 케이블트렁킹 시스템을 통해 배선해서는 안 된다. 또한 다심케이블을 병렬로 포
설하는 경우 각 케이블은 각상의 1가닥의 도체와 중성선이 있다면 중성선도 포함하
여야 한다.
2. 여러 개의 주회로에 공통 중성선을 사용하는 것은 허용되지 않는다. 다만, 단상 교류
최종 회로는 하나의 선 도체와 한 다상 교류회로의 중성선으로부터 형성 될 수도 있
다. 이 다상회로는 모든 선도체를 단로하도록 단로장치에 의해 설치하여야 한다.
3. 여러 회로가 하나의 접속 상자에서 단자 접속되는 경우 각 회로에 대한 단자는 KS
```
C IEC 60998(가정용 및 이와 유사한 용도의 저전압용 접속기구) 시리즈에 따른 접
```
```
속기 및 KS C IEC 60947-7-1(저전압 개폐장치 및 제어장치)에 따른 단자블록에 관
```
한 것을 제외하고 절연 격벽으로 분리해야한다.
4. 모든 도체가 최대공칭전압에 대해 절연되어 있다면 여러 회로를 동일한 전선관시스
템, 케이블덕팅시스템 또는 케이블트렁킹시스템의 분리된 구획에 설치할 수 있다.
232.3.2 병렬접속
```
두 개 이상의 선도체(충전도체) 또는 PEN도체를 계통에 병렬로 접속하는 경우, 다음에
```
- 220 -
따른다.
1. 병렬도체 사이에 부하전류가 균등하게 배분될 수 있도록 조치를 취한다. 도체가 같
은 재질, 같은 단면적을 가지고, 거의 길이가 같고, 전체 길이에 분기회로가 없으며
다음과 같을 경우 이 요구사항을 충족하는 것으로 본다.
```
가. 병렬도체가 다심케이블, 트위스트(twist) 단심케이블 또는 절연전선인 경우
```
```
나. 병렬도체가 비트위스트(non-twist) 단심케이블 또는 삼각형태(trefoil) 혹은 직사각형
```
```
(flat) 형태의 절연전선이고 단면적이 구리 50 ㎟, 알루미늄 70 ㎟ 이하인 것
```
```
다. 병렬도체가 비트위스트(non-twist) 단심케이블 또는 삼각형태(trefoil) 혹은 직사각
```
```
형(flat) 형태의 절연전선이고 단면적이 구리 50 ㎟, 알루미늄 70 ㎟를 초과하는
```
```
것으로 이 형상에 필요한 특수 배치를 적용한 것. 특수한 배치법(KS C IEC
```
```
60364-5-52 부속서 H를 참고한다)은 다른 상 또는 극의 조합과 이격으로 구성한
```
다.
2. 232.5.1에 적합하도록 부하전류 분배를 할 수 없거나 4가닥 이상의 도체를 병렬로
접속하는 경우에는 버스바트렁킹시스템의 사용을 고려한다.
232.3.3 전기적 접속

“부속서 E”에 나타내었다.
4. 보호도체로만 사용되는 도체(PE도체)은 고려하지 않는다. PEN도체는 중성선과 같은
방법으로 취급한다.

615.2 재료사용의 일반
615.2.1 압력에 의하여 응력을 받는 재료는 달리 허용된 경우를 제외하고는 KS B
6750 부표 1 및 ASME B31.1 Appendix A의 표에 열거한 재료, 또는 ASTM 재료규격과
같은 규격번호를 가지는 ASME 재료도 허용되나 주어진 응력 값 이상의 설계 온도에

일으켜서는 안 되며, 정격부하에서의 부하 차단 시 회전속도 최대상승값은 비상속도
조절기의 작동 회전속도 미만으로 하여야 한다. 다만, 발전기가 유도발전기인 경우에

2. 동기 발전기와 병렬 운전 중 터빈출력(유도 발전기 출력)의 변동분은 동기 발전기에
흡수되므로 증기터빈의 속도 및 부하는 변동하지 않는다. 따라서 출력을 조정하는
장치는 필요가 없다.

직각인 어느 다른 위치를 통과할 때, 그 지름 사이의 차이는 1%를 초과해서

645.19.3 중앙에 구멍이 있는 일체형 평경판
1. 중앙에 경판지름의 1/2를 초과하는 단일 원형 구멍이 있는 평경판은 다음 규
정에 따라서 설계하여야 한다. 중앙 구멍에 부착한 노즐이 있거나 없는 일체
형 평경판의 배치는 그림 645.19.3-1에 나타나 있다.
가. 동체-평경판의 접합은 표 645.19.1-1, 상세 1, 2, 3 및 4처럼 일체형이어야
하지만, 표 645.19.1-1, 상세 5 및 6에서의 이음매와 유사한 맞대기 용접 또
는 완전용입 모서리 용접을 사용할 수도 있다.
나. 평경판의 중앙 구멍에는 일체형 노즐 또는 완전용입 용접으로 부착한 노즐
```
또는 일체형이 아닌 용접(즉, 양면 필릿용접 또는 부분용입 용접)으로 부착
```
한 노즐이 있을 수 있거나 부착한 노즐이나 허브가 없는 구멍일 수 있다. 비
일체형 용접으로 부착한 노즐의 경우에는 경판은 부착된 노즐이나 허브가
없는 경판으로 설계한다.
2. 경판 두께는 위 645.19.1 또는 645.19.2의 규정은 만족하지 않아도 되지만, 평
경판 두께와 기타 형상 변수는 표 645.19.3-2의 허용응력 한계는 만족하여야
한다.
3. 단일 원형 구멍이 중앙에 있는 일체형 평경판을 설계하기 위하여 사용할 수
있는 절차는 아래와 같다.

3. 용기를 부분적으로 2회 이상 연소실 내부에서 가열하는 경우
```
용기의 가열될 부분이 적어도 1.5 m(5 ft)이상 겹친다면, 용접후열처리는 2회
